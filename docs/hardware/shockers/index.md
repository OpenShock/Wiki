# Shockers
At OpenShock we support a couple of different Shocker Models. All of them are based on 433 MHz RF for communication.  
They are controlled via a OpenShock Hub.

## Where to buy them

We recommend the [CaiXianlin](caixianlin.md) Shocker due to it being cheap and accessible to buy from AliExpress.
