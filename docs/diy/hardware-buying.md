# DIY Hardware

!!! tip "pre-built options available"
    Not interested in building your own OpenShock hub? Head over to the [Hardware vendors](../vendors/hardware/index.md).

These are the **recommendations** of the OpenShock maintainers. This list is **not** exhaustive. For a much more *wiki-style* information base, head to the [Hardware](../hardware/boards/index.md) section.

## Board

### Existing hardware

!!! info "Existing hardware"
    If you already own a PiShock or another ESP32, please check the [Boards compatibility list](../hardware/boards/index.md).

### ESP32-S3

We recommend the `ESP32-S3` chip, specifically the `N16R8` variant for its 16 MiB of flash. The [Wemos Lolin S3](../hardware/boards/wemos/lolin-s3.md) board satisfies all these criteria.

Requirements for the ESP are:
- Needs to be a **ESP32** specifically, including -S and -C variants! ESP8266 is **NOT** supported!
- Minimum flash size: 4MB

## 433 MHz Transmitter

See the [Transmitter](../hardware/transmitter/index.md) page for a quick one-stop shop.

## Shockers

See the [Shockers](../hardware/shockers/index.md) page for (yet another) one-stop shop.

## Assembly

Next, head over to [Assembly](../diy/assembling.md).
