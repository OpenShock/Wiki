::: info What is ShockOSC?
ShockOSC is an [OpenShock Desktop Module](https://github.com/OpenShock/Desktop) made for OSC to trigger your shockers from an in-game trigger.  
OSC is a protocol implemented in VRChat, ChilloutVR, etc. that allows the communication between the game and 3rd party applications.
