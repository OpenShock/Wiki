## Setup the OpenShock hub

1. Wirelessly connect your **Phone** to the hub:
    1. Plug your hub in and ensure it has power.
    2. On your phone, search for a Wi-Fi network named similar to ``OpenShock-XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`` and connect to it.

    :::
2. Connect to the hub via the network:
    1. Open your phone's browser and type in ``10.10.10.10`` *or* ``openshock.local`` this should open up a web-interface for the hub.
    2. Find your router's Wi-Fi network in the web-interface.
    3. Press the green button next to it and type in your Wi-Fi password, then press submit.
    *A green pop up should appear if it's connected successfully*

3. Set the RF TX Pin if needed

::: warning RF TX Pin
**DO NOT** change the RF TX Pin **UNLESS IT IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY DETECTED** *or* you are using a DIY hub.
This is an advanced feature. It should be set correctly by default after flashing the OpenShock firmware if you are using a known board.
If the pin is not automatically selected, you can open a Serial terminal and send the command `rftxpin #` where `#` is your pin number.
If you do not know how to do this, you can also re-enable the captive portal (hotspot of the Hub) to re-configure it. For more information see the page dedicated to your micro-controller under [boards](../../hardware/boards/index.md).

:::
1. Create a hub on the website:
    1. **On your PC** open [openshock.app](https://openshock.app/).
    2. Create an account. *(If you don't have one already)*
    3. Go to **Devices** and click the **green plus icon** at the lower right corner to create a new hub.
    4. Give it a name:
        1. Open the context menu of the hub. *(the three dots next to the newly created hub)*
        2. Select **edit**.
        3. Type in a name, *(your name for example)* into the name field.
        4. Press save.
