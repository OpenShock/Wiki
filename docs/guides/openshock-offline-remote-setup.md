# Offline Remote Setup

## What you need

- [Fully setup OpenShock Hub](../guides/openshock-first-setup.md)
- [OpenShock Account](https://openshock.app/)
- A Compatible Offline remote with it's ID

::: warning Important
Only the first channel on the remote will work. This is because the channel is not configurable on OpenShock's side yet

:::
::: warning Offline Remote ID
If you bought an offline remote from a vendor, it might already have been decoded and the **Offline Remote ID** might be present as a sticker on the remote.
You can also decode this ID yourself using a 433 Mhz Receiver module with an ESP32. Checkout the [rf-plaground repo](https://github.com/OpenShock/rf-playground)
