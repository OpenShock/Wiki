    Sorry, we haven't _quite_ finished this article yet. **In the meantime, feel free to hit us up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AHcCbXbEcF) if you have any trouble.**

!!! tip "Prebuilts available"

    Not interested in building your own OpenShock Bridge? Head over to the [Hardware vendors](../vendors/hardware/index.md).

These are the **recommendations** of the OpenShock maintainers. This list is **not** exhaustive. For a much more *wiki-style* information base, head to the [Hardware](../hardware/buying-guide.md) section.



## Board

### Existing hardware

!!! info "Existing hardware"

    If you already own a Pishock or another ESP32, please check the [Boards compatability list](../hardware/boards/index.md).

### ESP32-S3

We recommend the `ESP32-S3` chip, specifically the `N16R8` variant for its 16 MiB of flash. The [Wemos Lolin S3](../hardware/boards/wemos/lolin-s3.md) board satisfies all these criteria.

## 433MHz radio & antenna

See the [Radio](../hardware/radio/index.md) page for a quick one-stop shop.

## Shockers

See the [Shockers](../hardware/shockers/index.md) page for (yet another) one-stop shop.


## Assembly

Next, head over to [Assembly](../diy/assembling.md).
