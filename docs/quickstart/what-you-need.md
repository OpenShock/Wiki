# What you need

If you've found yourself here, chances are you're either looking to get shocked, or shock a friend or partner! We've written this quick start guide to help you get shocking as fast as possible.

## Requirements

To get started with OpenShock, you need three things:

### 1. An OpenShock server

This can be either a public or private OpenShock server. We recommend the [OpenShock.app](https://openshock.app/)public OpenShock instance.

Interested in hosting your own server? Check out the [Self-hosting](../diy/selfhosting.md) guide.

### 2. An OpenShock hub

A hub connects OpenShock to the shock device via a micro-controller and a 433 MHz transmitter.

- For pre-built options, check out the [Hardware vendors](../vendors/hardware/index.md).
- For building your own, after reading the [Buying guide](../quickstart/buying-guide.md), head over to our do it yourself [Assembly guide](../diy/assembling.md).

### 3. Shockers

This is the easy part! Head to the [Buying Guide](../quickstart/buying-guide.md) for all the information you'll need.
