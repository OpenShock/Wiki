  6.  After adding your shocker to the link you should be able to see the shockers controlls, that's it everyone with the share link can now controll your shocker.


   ## Customize your Share link
You can set limits to ``strenght`` ``duration`` or what kind of ``command`` someone can use for each new share link.  
You can also ``Pause`` the link so nobody can send commands via this link
